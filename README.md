# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to use JavaScript to create a table to organize UFO data, which will help Dana to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings on her webpage by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time instead of only filtering by date.

## Results

This webpage has five different search boxes on the left side of the page, which includes date, city, state, country, and shape. User can use these five different search boxes to filter information and the exact results will be returned to this page.

For example, if you want to find all matched information in the State of CA, after you enter ca in the "Enter a State" filter box and press Enter, the results will be returned accordingly.

## Summary

1. One drawback of this webpage
A dropdown list for each filter search box should be included.

2. Two additional recommendations for further development
First, there are 7 areas shown on the table but only 5 filter boxes on the left side of the webpage. I would like to suggest add more search filter boxes such as duration and comments.
Second, there is no click button and the only way to filter required information is to press Enter, which may be a little bit confuse to the user. Thus, I would like to suggest to add a click button named as Enter on the page for user to click.
